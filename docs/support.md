# Support

The Prodomo project is supported by you.

The project started as a clean and stable base for a future server and has continued (2019-202x) as a successful project.

The longevity and successful projects have provided us with a stable foundation of trust, and the ongoing support has helped us receive positive recommendations from Prodomo clients.

Main support channels are located in our :octicons-comment-24:[Discord][discord] server.

## Overall support

Our support has always been and will always be free.

 No client will ever pay for updates or fixes. This is a strict rule that we have enforced for a long time. We believe that no client, regardless of their level of knowledge, should
 have to pay to receive assistance. This rule has helped us evolve much more rapidly and brought us closer together as a community.

## Response time

However, all of this comes at a cost: our free time.

Although support is free, it is limited by our available free time (Essex & Maruski - main developers).

We have never condemned, nor will we ever condemn, the request and desire for help. The PD Discord is made for that purpose—to share good things, request help, or simply have discussions.

If we don't have time to assist you, you can be sure that someone from Prodomo will be more than happy to help you.

## Request

There is a chance that some users may not be familiar with the Prodomo project or interface.

This is not to be condemned; we will always look for a small window of time to help you.

Small systems, information related to QoL (Quality of Life), or gameplay creation will always be {==free==}.

Feel free and unconstrained to reach out to us[^1] for help.
